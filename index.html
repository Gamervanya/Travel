<h1 style="text-shadow:2px 2px grey"> Five Places To Visit In Paris </h1>
<ul class="style">
<li>
<h2> Louvre Museum </h2>
<img src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.y7Kr83-_FTk7SOjLJH-dYwHaEo&pid=Api&P=0&h=180" class="Louvre">

<img src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.XJV8sAkHM9UDOBITw2h2PwHaE5&pid=Api&P=0&h=180"class="Tower">
<p>The Eiffel Tower (French: La Tour Eiffel, [tuʁ ɛfɛl], IPA pronunciation: "EYE-full" English; "Eiffel" French) is a landmark in Paris. It was built between 1887 and 1889 for the Exposition Universelle (World Fair). It was supposed to be a temporary installation for the 1889 World Fair, held at Paris to show respect to 100 years of the French Revolution.[3] In 1909, there were discussions regarding the potential dismantling of the Eiffel Tower. However, the decision to save this iconic structure was ultimately reached by city officials, who acknowledged its importance as a radiotelegraphy station.</p>

<h2> Opéra Garnier </h2>

<P>The largest opera houses of Paris are the 19th-century Opéra Garnier (historical Paris Opéra) and modern Opéra Bastille; the former tends toward the more classic ballets and operas, and the latter provides a mixed repertoire of classic and modern. In the middle of the 19th century, there were three other active and competing opera houses: the Opéra-Comique, Théâtre-Italien and Théâtre Lyrique (which in modern times changed its profile and name to Théâtre de la Ville). Philharmonie de Paris, the modern symphonic concert hall of Paris, opened in January 2015. Another musical landmark is the Théâtre des Champs-Élysées, where the first performances of Diaghilev's Ballets Russes took place in 1913.</p>

<h2> Cathédrale Notre-Dame de Paris </h2>

<p>Notre-Dame de Paris, referred to simply as Notre-Dame,is a medieval Catholic cathedral on the Île de la Cité (an island in the Seine River), in the 4th arrondissement of Paris, France. The cathedral, dedicated to the Virgin Mary, is considered one of the finest examples of French Gothic architecture. Several attributes set it apart from the earlier Romanesque style, particularly its pioneering use of the rib vault and flying buttress, its enormous and colourful rose windows, and the naturalism and abundance of its sculptural decoration.Notre-Dame also stands out for its three pipe organs (one historic) and its immense church bells.</p>

<h2> Arc de Triomphe </h2>

<p>The Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile,often called simply the Arc de Triomphe, is one of the most famous monuments in Paris, France, standing at the western end of the Champs-Élysées at the centre of Place Charles de Gaulle, formerly named Place de l'Étoile—the étoile or "star" of the juncture formed by its twelve radiating avenues. The location of the arc and the plaza is shared between three arrondissements, 16th (south and west), 17th (north), and 8th (east). The Arc de Triomphe honours those who fought and died for France in the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, with the names of all French victories and generals inscribed on its inner and outer surfaces. Beneath its vault lies the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier from World War I.</p>
